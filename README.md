To use this, you must have Java installed, you need to download the JAR file in Releases, then run this JAR with the command:
```
java -jar animegen.jar -l NUMBER_OF_GENERATED_LINKS -n FILE_NAME -t TAG (only one)
```
Then a JSON file will be generated, which will contain your links under the incrementing IDs

You can make your changes in the code to build the project use `./gradlew build`. Pull Requests are welcomed!
